# Dune Analytics queries to determine locked torn

I looked at the difference between locked and unlocked tokens:

https://dune.xyz/queries/133750

And found this to be 1.356062583491274e+22

After calculations with the find_torn_distributed.js script, which gives the same results as:

https://dune.xyz/queries/133422

Which though leads to a discrepancy in amount locked with the above calculation, leading to an number of:

1.3920131191552333230524 Ã— 10^22

Which is approximately a 360 TORN difference.

One accidental transfer was found:

Equating to 27 TORN. Meaning there would still be 333 unexplained TORN left in the contract.

I would thus advise using 197916666666666636074666 as an input value at line 54 of GovernanceV2.sol:

```
(torn.balanceOf(address(this))).sub(IGovernanceVesting(GovernanceVesting).released().sub(197916666666666636074666))
```

For the reason that with this amount of TORN it would be more important to ensure the safety of the funds of a user.
The extra TORN would only stay reedemable by the user.

If wanted, an approval can be added for this amount of TORN in the same function to make the funds retrievable by governance in case
the funds are found to not belong to the user. A simple transferFrom would then suffice to transfer it out to governance again.
